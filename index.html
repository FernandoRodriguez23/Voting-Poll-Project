                    This is the voting website for the 1972 U.S Presidental Elections. If anyone is seen commiting fruad they will be fined and 
                    incarserated. Please Use this website once, we are new to this. U.S. election laws date back to Article 1 of the Constitution. 
                    This gave states the responsibility of overseeing federal elections.
                    Many Constitutional amendments and federal laws to protect voting rights have been passed since then. 
                    In the U.S., no one is required by law to vote in any local, state, or presidential election. 
                    According to the U.S. Constitution, voting is a right and a privilege. 
                    Many constitutional amendments have been ratified since the first election. 
                    However, none of them made voting mandatory for U.S. citizens
